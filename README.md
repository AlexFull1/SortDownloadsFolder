# Downloads Folder Sorter (C# Console Application)

A simple **C# console application** that automatically sorts files in the **Windows Downloads folder** by file type and moves them into appropriate directories.

This project was created to practice **OOP principles**, file system operations, and clean code structure in .NET.
